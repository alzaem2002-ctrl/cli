- View /home/runner/work/foo/foo

- Bash: Check current directory and list all files

> Let me check the README and any existing workflow files to understand the repository structure better:

- View /home/runner/work/foo/foo/.github

- Bash: Check if there are any existing scripts or build files

- View /home/runner/work/foo/foo/.github/workflows

? Thought:: Looking at the repository structure, I can see:

1. This is a minimal repository with just a README.md and some GitHub workflows
2. There are no existing shell scripts or build infrastructure
3. The repository appears to be a simple project without any specific language or framework constraints
4. There are GitHub workflows but they seem to be for general CI/CD purposes

For the task "add a shell script to print os information", I need to:
1. Create a shell script that displays relevant OS information
2. Make it executable
3. Consider where to place it in the repository structure
4. Since this is a minimal repository, I should keep the script simple and place it in the root or a scripts directory
5. The script should display useful OS information like:
   - Operating system name and version
   - Kernel version
   - Architecture
   - CPU information
   - Memory information
   - Disk space
   - Uptime

Since there's no existing test infrastructure and the instructions mention I can skip tests if there's no existing test infrastructure, I won't need to create tests.

Let me plan the minimal changes:
1. Create a shell script (os_info.sh) in the root directory
2. Make it executable
3. Test it works correctly
4. Update README if appropriate

> Now let me report my plan and create the shell script:

! Progress update: Initial plan: Add shell script to print OS information

> Now let me create the shell script with comprehensive OS information:

- Create /home/runner/work/foo/foo/os_info.sh

> Now let me make the script executable and test it:

- Bash: Make script executable and test it

> Great! The script works perfectly. Now let me update the README to document the new script:

- Edit /home/runner/work/foo/foo/README.md

> Let me verify the changes look good:

- Bash: Check file permissions and final status

- View /home/runner/work/foo/foo/README.md

> Perfect! Let me test the script one more time to make sure everything is working correctly and commit the changes:

- Bash: Final test of the script

> Excellent! Now let me commit all the changes:

! Progress update: Add os_info.sh shell script to display OS information

> Perfect! I have successfully implemented the shell script to print OS information. Let me run the CodeQL security checker to ensure there are no security vulnerabilities:

> Excellent! The security analysis shows no vulnerabilities. 

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task by adding a comprehensive shell script to print OS information. Here's what was implemented:

### âœ… **Completed Changes:**

1. **Created `os_info.sh`** - A robust, executable shell script that displays:
   - Operating system name and version (with smart detection for different Linux distros)
   - Kernel version and architecture
   - CPU model and core count
   - Memory usage (total and available)
   - Disk space usage for root filesystem
   - System uptime
   - Current date and time

2. **Updated README.md** - Added comprehensive documentation including:
   - Usage instructions
   - Description of information displayed
   - System requirements

3. **Made the script executable** and thoroughly tested its functionality

### ðŸ”§ **Key Features:**

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on various Linux distributions with fallback mechanisms
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles missing commands or files
- **User-friendly output**: Clean formatting with emoji icons and organized sections
- **Comprehensive information**: Covers all major system information categories
- **Executable permissions**: Properly set for immediate use

The script is ready to use and provides a complete overview of the operating system information as requested. It has been tested and works correctly on the current Ubuntu system, displaying all relevant OS details in an organized and readable format.
