I'll help you implement a shell script to print OS information. Let me start
  by exploring the repository structure to understand the codebase and then   
  create a plan.

Let me check the README and any existing workflow files to understand the   
  repository structure better:

Thought

Looking at the repository structure, I can see:                             
                                                                              
  1. This is a minimal repository with just a README.md and some GitHub       
  workflows                                                                   
  2. There are no existing shell scripts or build infrastructure              
  3. The repository appears to be a simple project without any specific       
  language or framework constraints                                           
  4. There are GitHub workflows but they seem to be for general CI/CD purposes
                                                                              
  For the task "add a shell script to print os information", I need to:       
                                                                              
  1. Create a shell script that displays relevant OS information              
  2. Make it executable                                                       
  3. Consider where to place it in the repository structure                   
  4. Since this is a minimal repository, I should keep the script simple and  
  place it in the root or a scripts directory                                 
  5. The script should display useful OS information like:                    
      • Operating system name and version                                     
      • Kernel version                                                        
      • Architecture                                                          
      • CPU information                                                       
      • Memory information                                                    
      • Disk space                                                            
      • Uptime                                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Since there's no existing test infrastructure and the instructions mention I
  can skip tests if there's no existing test infrastructure, I won't need to  
  create tests.                                                               
                                                                              
  Let me plan the minimal changes:                                            
                                                                              
  1. Create a shell script (os_info.sh) in the root directory                 
  2. Make it executable                                                       
  3. Test it works correctly                                                  
  4. Update README if appropriate


Now let me report my plan and create the shell script:

Progress update: Initial plan: Add shell script to print OS information

Adding a shell script to print OS information as requested.                 
                                                                              
  **Plan:**                                                                   
                                                                              
  [ ] Create shell script os_info.sh in root directory that displays          
  comprehensive OS information                                                
  [ ] Include OS name/version, kernel, architecture, CPU, memory, disk space, 
  and uptime information                                                      
  [ ] Make script executable                                                  
  [ ] Test script functionality on current system                             
  [ ] Update README.md to document the new script                             
  [ ] Verify all changes work as expected


Now let me create the shell script with comprehensive OS information:

  I have successfully completed the task by adding a comprehensive shell      
  script to print OS information. Here's what was implemented:                
                                                                              
  ### ✅ **Completed Changes:**                                               
                                                                              
  1. **Created **os_info.sh - A robust, executable shell script that displays:
      • Operating system name and version (with smart detection for different 
      Linux distros)                                                          
      • Kernel version and architecture                                       
      • CPU model and core count                                              
      • Memory usage (total and available)                                    
      • Disk space usage for root filesystem                                  
      • System uptime                                                         
      • Current date and time                                                 
  2. **Updated README.md** - Added comprehensive documentation including:

      • System requirements                                                   
  3. **Made the script executable** and thoroughly tested its functionality   
                                                                              
  ### 🔧 **Key Features:**                                                    
                                                                              
  • **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on various Linux distributions    
  with fallback mechanisms                                                    
  • **Error handling**: Gracefully handles missing commands or files          
  • **User-friendly output**: Clean formatting with emoji icons and organized 
  sections                                                                    
  • **Comprehensive information**: Covers all major system information        
  categories                                                                  
  • **Executable permissions**: Properly set for immediate use                
                                                                              
  The script is ready to use and provides a complete overview of the operating
  system information as requested. It has been tested and works correctly on  
  the current Ubuntu system, displaying all relevant OS details in an         
  organized and readable format.
