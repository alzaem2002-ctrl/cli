			Search across all of GitHub.

			Excluding search results that match a qualifier

			In a browser, the GitHub search syntax supports excluding results that match a search qualifier
			by prefixing the qualifier with a hyphen. For example, to search for issues that
			do not have the label "bug", you would use %[1]s-label:bug%[1]s as a search qualifier.

			%[1]sgh%[1]s supports this syntax in %[1]sgh search%[1]s as well, but it requires extra
			syntax to avoid the hyphen being interpreted as a command line flag because it begins with a hyphen.

			On Unix-like systems, you can use the %[1]s--%[1]s argument to indicate that
			the arguments that follow are not a flag, but rather a query string. For example:

			$ gh search issues -- "my-search-query -label:bug"

			On PowerShell, you must use both the %[1]s--%[2]s%[1]s argument and the %[1]s--%[1]s argument to
			produce the same effect. For example:

			$ gh --%[2]s search issues -- "my search query -label:bug"
