        "\n",

        "Before we begin, let's quickly review how Agenta versions prompts:\n",
        "\n",
        "Agenta follows a structure similar to **git** for prompt versioning. Instead of having one commit history, it uses **multiple branches (called variants)** where changes can be committed, and **environments** where these changes can be deployed (and used in your application).\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow for deploying a change to production that we'll follow in this tutorial is:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a new variant\n",
        "2. Commit a change to that variant\n",
        "3. Deploy that commit (variant/version) to the production environment\n",
        "4. Commit a new change to that variant\n",
        "5. Fetch the config from that environment\n"
